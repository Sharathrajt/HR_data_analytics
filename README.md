# HR Analytics (SQL + PowerBI)

Increasing organizational effectiveness and fostering an inclusive workplace culture require a deep understanding of workforce dynamics. This project aims to leverage HR data analysis and visualization techniques using SQL and PowerBI to gain insights into employee demographics, retention patterns, and performance indicators. By identifying key trends and areas for improvement, the project seeks to inform strategic HR decision-making and optimize talent management strategies within the organization.

### Data Management and SQL Analysis:

•	Utilized SQL querying techniques to conduct comprehensive analysis of HR data stored in the 'hr_analytics' database.

•	Implemented complex queries to cleanse and standardize data, including column renaming, date format standardization, and NULL value handling.

•	Employed SQL functions such as str_to_date, date_format, timestampdiff, and case statements to manipulate and transform data, facilitating deeper insights into workforce demographics, tenure, and termination rates.

### Insights Derived from SQL Analysis:

•	Analyzed gender distribution, race demographics, age trends, and termination rates using SQL queries, uncovering valuable insights into workforce composition and dynamics.

•	Employed conditional aggregation and grouping techniques to derive actionable insights, such as departmental termination rates and tenure distribution.

### Power BI Dashboard:

•	Designed and developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize the results of SQL analysis, using interactive charts and graphs to present data-driven narratives effectively.

•	Customized dashboard components to align with stakeholder preferences, enhancing accessibility and usability of HR insights.

### Project Impact and Reflection:

•	The project deepened my understanding of SQL data analysis techniques and their application in HR analytics, enhancing my technical skill set.

•	Insights derived from SQL analysis contributed to informed decision-making and strategic planning in human resource management, underscoring the value of data-driven approaches
